This is a repository for my project:

# Live-Search-Application-using-JavaScript-jQuery-and-Ajax

The ability to read data and communicate information asynchronously is fundamental to modern web applications.In this, I have done this project by integrating AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) with JavaScript and jQueryâ€”a combination that makes it easy to work with dynamic data and reduces the number of requests to the server.
